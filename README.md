# Puppet Contributor Summit 2019 in Budapest

## Vox Pupuli

This is a spntanous Vox Pupuli ignite talk that I did during the contributor
summit. Topic was how Vox Pupuli handles the amount of pull requests / how we
automate this. You can find more of my talks in [my main repository](https://github.com/bastelfreak/talks#collection-of-talks-proposals-and-related-stuff).
There is also a [pdf](Vox_Pupuli_-_Managing_PRs_Contributor_Summit_2019_-_Tim_Meusel.pdf)
and an [online version](https://bastelfreak.de/contributorsummit2019/).
